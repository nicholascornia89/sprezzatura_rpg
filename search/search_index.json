Inspired by the principal Pythagorean musical proportions of the unison (1:1), octave (2:1), fifth and its complementary fourth (3:2 and 4:3) and major intervals of the third, sixth and tenth (respectively 5:4, 5:3 and 5:2), I have designed a dice-poll system where successes are collected by pairing dice to achieve the aforementioned proportions.</p> <p>Here a table describing all possible pairings given two d6s:</p> d6 x d6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 unison octave 2 octave unison fifth octave maj. tenth 3 fifth unison fourth maj. sixth octave 4 octave fourth unison maj. third fifth 5 maj. tenth maj. sixth maj. third unison 6 octave fifth unison <p>As you would notice, there are 6 possibilities for unison (corresponding to the diagonal of the matrix), 6 for octaves (when the ratio between two values gives 2), 6 for fifth and fourth and 6 for major third and sixth. Each of the four categories is equiprobable, and counted toegther gives a total probability of success of 24/36 = 66 %.</p>"},{"location":"game_mechanics/#consonances","title":"Consonances","text":""},{"location":"game_mechanics/#resonance-poll","title":"Resonance poll","text":""},{"location":"game_mechanics/#dissonances","title":"Dissonances","text":""},{"location":"game_mechanics/#setting-position-and-effect-forged-in-the-dark","title":"Setting Position and Effect (Forged in the Dark)","text":""},{"location":"game_mechanics/#aspects-minor-arcana","title":"Aspects &amp; Minor Arcana","text":""},{"location":"game_mechanics/#major-arcana","title":"Major Arcana","text":""},{"location":"game_mechanics/#the-royal-game-of-the-goose","title":"The Royal Game of the Goose","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Attributes based on approaches are inspired by Legend of the Five Rings 5th Edition and Fate Accelerated.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"introduction/","title":"What is this game about?","text":"<p> Following Jared Sorensen's Three Big Questions I would like to introduce Sprezzatura as a game about cooperative storytelling, unexpected narratives, character growth and wit. The game is based on a custom game-engine called the Resonance System: a cooperative dice-poll system inspired by Pythagorean intervals and the Harmony of the Spheres.</p> <p>Furthermore, at the players' disposal comes a metacurrency system based on Major Arcana and Minor Arcanas of tarot cards. Finally, the long-term growth of the story and characters is regulated by a mini-game similar to the Royal Game of the Goose.</p> <p>Interaction and sharing agency on the story with other players is encouraged by the Resonance System, while living up to their character's believes and motivations will provide more metacurrency cards to control dice-poll's randomness.</p>"},{"location":"playing_the_game/","title":"Welcome to MkDocs","text":"<p>Here come some example of play, setting a campaing and other useful tips.</p>"},{"location":"references/","title":"Welcome to MkDocs","text":"<p>A list of inspirational material</p>"},{"location":"references/#books","title":"Books","text":"<p>Ariosto, Ludovico.
