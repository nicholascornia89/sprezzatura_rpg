The game is based on a custom game-engine called the Resonance System: a cooperative dice-poll system inspired by Pythagorean intervals and the Harmony of the Spheres.</p> <p>Furthermore, at the players' disposal comes a metacurrency system based on Major and Minor Arcanas of tarots. Finally, the long-term growth of the story and characters is regulated by a mini-game similar to the Royal Game of the Goose.</p> <p>Interaction and sharing agency on the story with other players is encouraged by the Resonance System, while living up to their character's believes and motivations will provide more metacurrency cards to control dice-poll's randomness.</p>"},{"location":"playing_the_game/","title":"Welcome to MkDocs","text":"<p>Here come some example of play, setting a campaing and other useful tips.</p>"},{"location":"references/","title":"Welcome to MkDocs","text":"<p>A list of inspirational material</p>"},{"location":"references/#books","title":"Books","text":""},{"location":"references/#games","title":"Games","text":""},{"location":"references/#music","title":"Music","text":""},{"location":"references/#academic-articles","title":"Academic Articles","text":""}]}
